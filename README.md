# Tokenized

Hey folks, I am Senkottuvelan, a complete React Newbie.

This is a simple application that I made for Supabase Hackathon. We all know waiting in queues is a big headache. So when I heard about this hackathon, I thought why not make a application that utilize the Supabase Realtime Database. Hence I did it.

## Simple Description About this App.
I got to know about this app only before today(5th August) and I had only this idea. So, I decided to implement this realtime database system and made a very simple application that updates the token status realtime for users. There is no login system implemented as I was rushing to finish this ðŸ˜‚. I barely managed to complete it within the given time.
That's it from my side and thank you to Supabase for this oppurtunity!

## How to use this App?

The Admin Endpoint will be used by the employee who works in a organization or a place where there is a queue.
The User Endpoint will be used by the user who books a token for waiting for a service by the organization.

## An Example Scenario

Take a hospital,
There will be patients waiting for their turn which is a tedious thing and it becomes even worse when you are sick. Now, imagine the same situation with this App. You will be at your home and after you book your token you can see the live updation of tokens and can go to the hospital based on the number of tokens and there will be zero or minimal waiting time.

Since this is a very simple application, both the Admin and User enpoints are open. Just open them in two different tabs and play around with it.
