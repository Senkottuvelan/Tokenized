# Tokenized

Hey folks, I am Senkottuvelan, a complete React Newbie.

This is a simple application that I made for Supabase Hackathon. We all know waiting in queues is a big headache. So when I heard about this hackathon, I thought why not make a application that utilize the Supabase Realtime Database. Hence I did it.

## Simple Description About this App.
I got to know about this app only before today(5th August) and I had only this idea. So, I decided to implement this realtime database system and made a very simple application that updates the token status realtime for users. There is no login system implemented as I was rushing to finish this ðŸ˜‚. I barely managed to complete it within the given time.
That's it from my side and thank you to Supabase for this oppurtunity!
